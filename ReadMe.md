# Python-Base64-File-Decoder

Decrypt a file that contains a base64 encoded text multiple times. By default the script will decode it 5 times.

Syntax: python b64_decoder.py [FILE]

This will output the decoded message to the command line

Feel free to send the output to a file like so,"python b64_decoder.py FILE > OUTPUTFILE"
